Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> expression
Rule 1     expression -> expression PLUS term
Rule 2     expression -> expression MINUS term
Rule 3     expression -> term
Rule 4     term -> term TIMES factor
Rule 5     term -> term DIVIDE factor

Terminals, with rules where they appear

DIVIDE               : 5
MINUS                : 2
NUMBER               : 7
PLUS                 : 1
TIMES                : 4
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear
